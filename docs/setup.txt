This creation step cannot be automated, at least that's my current thinking.
The first step is to create the meteor app using the command:

meteor create simple-todos

This is done within the todo server and because of file sharing, it will be
created in the correct directory.
In the Vagrantfile, add the following entry:

config.vm.synced_folder "./", "/developer"

Then when the VM is running, change to the /developer directory and issue the
above meteor create command.
